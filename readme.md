"Things I've Heard People Say" is for anyone who wants to save their favorite motivational quotes, jokes, life hacks, ice-breaker trivia, etc. on an ~~easily searchable,~~ editable web app. Personally, I built it to use it like a sort of bibliography page for whenever I need to encourage people at meetings or one-on-ones. It'll probably continue to be shaped by the needs/preferences of people who give last-minute pep-talks/lectures/guidances regularly. ~~But perhaps most importantly of all, I never have jokes at the top of my head so hopefully collecting them here will help make me A SOCIAL FUCKING BUTTERFLY. Jk, probs won't. Reading jokes off a phone would more than likely lose me more social butterfly points than anything.~~ ðŸ¤“
